# Flick
The **Flick** App allows users to view videos and create new videos with a selfie overlay in the bottom left corner.

## Introduction
The Video Overlay Creator App is designed to enhance video content by allowing users to overlay a selfie onto existing videos. This can be useful for creating personalized video messages, adding branding elements, or simply for fun and creative purposes.

## Installation

## Steep 1: Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pawannitt-26/Flicks
cd flick/
```

## Step 2: Install dependencies
```bash
# using npm
npm install
```

## Step 3: Start the Metro Server
First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.
To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 4: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
